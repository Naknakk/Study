/*
 
 Call the start() function before you write any of your own code.
 It can be called two ways:

 - No arguments: scene dimensions will be 417x820
 start()

 - Arguments for width and height
 start(withWidth: <width>, height: <height>)
 
 The playground is set to run manually, since it can take a while to get started every time you change a bit of your code. Be sure to click the run button at the bottom left of the editor area when you're ready to see your code in action.
